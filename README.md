# FarmFlow

FarmFlow is a multi-tenant farm operations platform built with Next.js. It combines field operations, processing, sales, finance, compliance, and admin tooling in a single web app.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16 (App Router)
- React 19 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Vitest + Playwright

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Configure environment variables:

- Copy required keys into `.env.local`.
- Keep secrets out of source control.

3. Run development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

4. Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Quality Checks

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

## End-to-End Tests

```bash
pnpm test:e2e
```

If your auth flow requires seeded credentials, run:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e:auth
```

## Phone + App Install

FarmFlow is configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

1. Deploy in production (`pnpm build && pnpm start` or your hosting platform).
2. Open FarmFlow on your phone browser.
3. Install to home screen:
- Android (Chrome): use the browser install prompt.
- iPhone (Safari): Share -> Add to Home Screen.

Installed mode runs full-screen and supports offline write queue sync.

## Native App Packaging (Optional)

If you want App Store / Play Store binaries:

1. Keep this Next.js app as-is.
2. Wrap it with Capacitor (or similar WebView shell).
3. Use iOS/Android projects generated by Capacitor for store submission.
